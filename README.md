# My Personal AI Practice

Welcome to my personal AI practice repository! This repository is my playground for experimenting with various AI concepts and algorithms.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

1. **Practice**: It allows me to practice implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch.
2. **Experiment**: I can experiment with different datasets, parameters, and techniques.
3. **Learning**: I use this repository as my personal reference for concepts I've learned.
